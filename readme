A collection of custom-made layouts for Unexpected keyboard
===========================================================

This repository stores some layouts for Unexpected Keyboard:
https://github.com/Julow/Unexpected-Keyboard.

Most of these layouts were inspired by thumb-key:
https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key, adjusted to suit my needs.

"QWERTY (US).xml" is just the default UnK layout with no offsets.

"Dozen" layouts are inspired by Type-Split, available in thumb-key.
