Unexpected Keyboard ThumbKey Inspired Two Hands Layouts
=======================================================

This repository stores some layouts for Unexpected Keyboard:
https://github.com/Julow/Unexpected-Keyboard.

These layouts were inspired by thumb-key:
https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key, adjusted to suit my needs.

-------------------------------------------------------

It also includes a script to generate two-hands layouts from nine
keys.

Write your 9-key Unexpected Keyboard layout to some file, say
"thumbkey.xml". Change "bottom.xml" (bottom row) and "middle.xml"
(middle column) as you see fit.

Then, do:
$ ./script.sed thumbkey.xml
to get your two-hands layout.
